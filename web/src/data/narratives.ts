      short: "Dollar funding is tight: DXY is surging, USDJPY is breaking lower, equities and BBB credit are under pressure, and oil plus gold are being sold.",
      medium: "The current tape is a dollar-liquidity squeeze. Equities are falling, volatility is elevated, BBB spreads are wider, DXY is bid, USDJPY is lower, and both crude and gold are being liquidated rather than acting like clean hedges.",
      full: "Professional read: this is a dollar-liquidity squeeze with commodity and gold liquidation. The active condition is broad de-risking through lower equities, higher volatility, wider lower-quality credit, a stronger DXY, weaker USDJPY, and heavy selling in crude and gold. The curve signal is secondary; the main portfolio sensitivity is dollar funding, high-beta credit, commodity beta, and positions that assume gold is providing a normal haven offset.",

    key: "safe_haven_risk_off",
    label: "Safe-haven risk-off",
    variants: {
      short: "Risk assets are soft, volatility is up, Treasury yields are lower, gold is bid, and credit is showing stress.",
      medium: "The tape is defensive but not a pure dollar squeeze. Equities are selling off, VIX is firmer, BBB spreads are wider, Treasury yields are lower, and gold is catching a haven bid while the dollar channel is less dominant.",
      full: "Professional read: the condition is a safety bid around an equity-credit drawdown. Transmission runs from weaker equities and firmer volatility into lower-quality credit stress, lower Treasury yields, and gold demand. The important distinction is that gold and duration are confirming defense, while FX is not the only channel carrying the stress.",

  {
    key: "weak_dollar_commodity_bid",
    label: "Weak-dollar commodity bid",
    variants: {
      short: "DXY is heavy, USDJPY is firm, crude and gold are bid, rates are a touch higher, and credit is mostly calm.",
      medium: "The active condition is a weak-dollar commodity repricing. DXY is lower while USDJPY, crude, and gold are higher; Treasury yields are only modestly firmer and BBB credit is quiet.",
      full: "Professional read: this is a weak-dollar hard-asset bid with restrained credit stress. The trigger is a softer DXY alongside a firmer USDJPY cross, stronger crude, and stronger gold. Transmission reaches rates through a small backup, but BBB credit remains anchored, so the scenario is commodity/FX-led rather than broad credit deterioration.",

    key: "rates_tightening_pressure",
    label: "Rates tightening pressure",
    variants: {
      short: "Treasury yields are backing up, the dollar is firm, equities are struggling, and volatility is grinding higher.",
      medium: "The current condition is rates-led tightening pressure. The front end and long end are firmer, DXY is supported, equities are under duration pressure, and volatility is rising without a full credit accident.",
      full: "Professional read: the market is repricing around higher rates and a firmer dollar. Equities are struggling with duration pressure, volatility is grinding higher, and credit is fragile but not the first mover. The key exposure is growth-sensitive equity beta and duration-sensitive carry, not a classic safe-haven liquidation.",

      medium: "The tape is post-stress reflation relief. SPX is higher, VIX is lower, crude is participating, BBB credit is improving, and high-grade spreads remain the main unresolved split.",
      full: "Professional read: risk appetite is recovering after stress, but the confirmation is uneven. Equity beta and volatility compression lead the move, crude provides reflation support, and BBB spreads improve. The main ambiguity is high-grade credit basis pressure, so the condition is relief with a credit quality split rather than a clean broad-risk rally.",

  {
    key: "split_credit_quality_stress",
    label: "Split credit-quality stress",
    variants: {
      short: "BBB credit is widening while high-grade behaves differently; risk tone is mixed and the spread signal is the issue.",
      medium: "The active condition is split credit-quality stress. Lower-quality spreads are under pressure, high-grade spreads do not confirm in the same direction, and cross-asset risk signals are mixed rather than one-way.",
      full: "Professional read: this is not a simple risk-on or risk-off state. The key condition is divergence inside credit quality: BBB spreads point to stress while high-grade credit is moving differently. Equities, FX, rates, and commodities provide partial context, but portfolio sensitivity should be framed around credit-quality basis and hedges that assume spread cohorts move together.",
